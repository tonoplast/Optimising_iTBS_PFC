### Impact of different intensities of intermittent theta burst stimulation on the cortical properties during TMS‐EEG and working memory performance
Published paper: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hbm.23882

This study presents the impact of different intensities of iTBS on cortical properties using TMS-EEG. In this paper, 
the importance of the intensity of prefrontal iTBS is demonstrated using three different
intensities, 50%, 75% and 100% of individuals’ resting motor threshold. The effect of iTBS on
the working memory performance is also examined, and whether the intensity of iTBS has
any effect on the behavioural outcome. Finally, potential clinical implications are discussed.

In terms of MATLAB codes, it uses semi-automated methods of cleaning TMS-EEG / EEG data 
and analysing TMS/task-evoked potentials and oscillations.

Non-parametic cluster-based permutation statistics were used in the data analysis.

There are two main measures; (1) Single-pulse TMS and (2) N-back task EEG.
Both look at evoked potentials and oscillations (power).
