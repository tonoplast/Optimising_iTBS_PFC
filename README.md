## Optimising_iTBS_PFC

This repository contains MATLAB scripts that were used in the PhD thesis called
"Developing optimal methods for theta burst prefrontal brain stimulation".

Theta burst stimulation (TBS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique which has the ability to alter brain activity in humans. Due to its rapid administration duration, TBS has gained popularity both in research and clinical trials. Despite its benefits, wide adoption of this technique in the treatment of psychiatric disorders has been limited due to the lack of understanding of its effects when it is applied to the prefrontal. In addition, little is known about the effect of different stimulation parameters. The aim of this thesis was to develop the optimal method of TBS application in the prefrontal cortex.

The PhD thesis can be found here:

There are 4 experimental studies that utilised MATLAB codes for either or both experimental procedures and/or data analyses.

These are: 

#####1. Demonstration of short-term plasticity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with theta burst stimulation: A TMS-EEG study
    Published paper: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1388245717301517
    
#####2. Impact of different intensities of intermittent theta burst stimulation on the cortical properties during TMS‐EEG and working memory performance
    Published paper: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hbm.23882

#####3. The effect of single and repeated prefrontal intermittent theta burst stimulation on cortical reactivity and working memory
    https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1935861X18300305
    
#####4. The effects of individualised intermittent theta burst stimulation in the prefrontal cortex: A TMS‐EEG study
    https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hbm.24398
    

Each project utilises toolboxes written by other researchers, and I have modified where it suited. Tools needed are:

   1. Analysis_Toolbox (included in this repository)
   2. EEGLAB - https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/download.php
   3. FastICA_25 - https://research.ics.aalto.fi/ica/fastica/ (it can also be downloaded via EEGLAB)
   4. TESA - https://nigelrogasch.github.io/TESA/

Thank you, and I wish you all the best.
