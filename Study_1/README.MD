Demonstration of short-term plasticity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with theta burst stimulation: A TMS-EEG study 
Published paper: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1388245717301517

This study demonstrates TBS-induced plasticity in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex using TMS-EEG technique. 
In this paper, the effects of iTBS and cTBS are examined in the DLPFC using single- and paired-pulse paradigms. 
The change in cortical plastic is measured via TMS-evoked potentials, particularly in N100, 
and TMS-evoked oscillations. The utility of TMS-EEG in tracking TBS-induced changes in DLPFC is discussed, 
together with a potential link between TMS-evoked N100 and cortical inhibition.

In terms of MATLAB codes, it uses semi-automated methods of cleaning TMS-EEG data and analysing TMS-evoked potentials and oscillations.

Non-parametic cluster-based permutation statistics were used in the data analysis.
